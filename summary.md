1. What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
2. Why the test failed at first?
3. Why you corrected the test that way?
4. Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?

-- ArrayTest
1. to know concept push and pop and how to construct good proper array initialization https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-pop-method-in-java/
2. the test failed at first because wrong logic was initiated because the logic is not finished so i verified the logic first to test whether the mechanism of push and pop so i test and test until the test succeed.
3. to test whether push and pop is working and expected result is same with the actual result
4. none

-- CollectionsTest
Test1 should_go_through_an_iterator
1. to know how to use iterator https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_using_iterator.htm
2. error will occur if code change will not happen so i just simply base the logic to the document on how to use iterator and run test once and it succeed.
3. to test whether the iterator logic that i formulate is compatible to the actual result of the test
4. None

Test2 should_create_a_sequence_without_putting_all_items_into_memory
1. to know how to create sequence with extends iterator function. Creating a own version of iterator.
2. error will occur if code change will not happen so i just simple edit the overiding function of iterator and make the iterator function as my some what for loop function without declaring any function of iterator. at first i got error because my logic is not correct and i dont understand the flow of the logic but when i edit again and run it successfully passed the test.
3. to test whether the my own iterator is doing its function to got the actual result from expected result.
4. None

Test3 should_predict_linked_list_operation_result
1. to know how to predict linked list operation result
2. error will occur if code change will not happen so i just simply base the logic and check all inherited class from the iterator class and derived the answer base on the logic function of the iterator.
3. to test whether the my own iterator is doing its function to got the actual result from expected result.
4. None

Test4 should_generate_distinct_sequence_on_the_fly
1. to know how to generate distinct sequence iterator.
2. error will occur if code change will not happen so just create my own implementations of how to distinct the value inside of billion size of iterator. i failed the test more that 10x because i still finding out how formulate my own logic to distinct the values given in the iterator and own implementation of iterator. So after final logic of iterator it succeed.
3. to test whether the my own iterator is doing its function to got the actual result from expected result.
4. None

Test5 should_reflects_back_to_original_list_for_sub_range
1. to know how value will reflect back to the original list base from the sub range
2. error will occur if code change will not happen so i just read the code and from what i understand, sublist is just getting the range of index and getting the array list base from the range and the sublist clear its value so the array inside integer with specific range was removed so when i run the test once, it succeed.
3. to test whether the my own iterator is doing its function to got the actual result from expected result.
4. None
