1. What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
2. Why the test failed at first?
3. Why you corrected the test that way?
4. Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?

-- ArrayTest
1. to know concept push and pop and how to construct good proper array initialization https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-pop-method-in-java/
2. the test failed at first because wrong logic was initiated because the logic is not finished so i verified the logic first to test whether the mechanism of push and pop so i test and test until the test succeed.
3. to test whether push and pop is working and expected result is same with the actual result
4. none

-- CollectionsTest
Test1 should_go_through_an_iterator
1. to know how to use iterator https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_using_iterator.htm
2. error will occur if code change will not happen so i just simply base the logic to the document on how to use iterator and run test once and it succeed.
3. to test whether the iterator logic that i formulate is compatible to the actual result of the test
4. None
